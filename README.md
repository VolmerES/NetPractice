## 🧠 What is NetPractice?

**NetPractice** is a networking project from the 42 Common Core.

It teaches the fundamentals of **IP addressing**, **subnetting**, and **routing** through a fully visual and interactive interface.

📡 You'll have to configure correct IP addresses, subnet masks, and routes between devices to achieve full network connectivity.

## ⚙️ How does it work?

Your goal in each level is to connect **all devices correctly**.

✔ Assign a **valid IP address** to each host

✔ Use the correct **subnet mask**

✔ Add **manual routes** to reach remote networks

💡 Visual connections are not enough. Always use `ping` to verify actual connectivity.
